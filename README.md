# wtt-scraping
Some unofficial WIP project of obscure firefox extension

## Description

I will try here to give a very brief description of this project. As the name greatly suggest, I am currently trying to achieve database stealing from the WTT website. One of my first ideas, maybe not the greatest, was to design and develop a firefox extension to extract automatically the small part of the database that you encounter each time you play. Whereas real web scraping is an efficient, quick and reliable way to get this type of information, I prefer to use a slow, unreliable but joyful method where you actually have to play to fill your database. Thereby, you become a good player before you can use the entire database to get even better. This passion for web may comes from my childhood, when my mother [...] and I am proud to present you the probably unique, proven inefficient and practically anti-productive firefox extension WTT-scraping !

## Future goals

If future ideas comes to my mind during the development, I'll be sure to communicate it in this section. For the moment:
- automatically paste the songs to your clipboard, without clicking on a button;
- handle everything, from the scraping to the statistics of the database;
- print more stats at the end of each game;
- hide a button to play PapasPizzeria in the popup
